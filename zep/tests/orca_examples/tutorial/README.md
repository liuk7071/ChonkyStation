# Tutorial

This is an interactive tutorial created in Orca itself, to get started, open Orca and press `CmdOrCtrl+L` to load the files found in this directory, then press `CmdOrCtrl+B` and write `inject:begin`, and press `enter`.

You should see 3 lines at the top of your files, to load a slide, locate the `$in:slide0` text, move your cursor onto the `$`(commander) operator and press `enter`. To navigate to another slide, change the value to `$in:slide1`, and activate the commander operator once more.

Good luck!
